Hello, My name is junior garmendia and I am in my second year of college. First year at NOVA
I am learning how to use GitHub becaue I am leading a group of people to make a Pathfinder visualiser
in which we will visualize pathfinding algorightms.
I hope I will learn a lot in these next two to three months of working!
